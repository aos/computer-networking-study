# Network Layer

Shortcomings of switches:
1. don't scale across large networks
2. don't work across more than one link layer technology (3G, 802.11, etc.)
3. don't give much traffic control

Routing vs. Forwarding
- **Routing**: process of deciding which direction to send traffic.
    Network wide (global) and expensive
- **Forwarding**: process of sending a packet on its way.
    Node process (local) and fast
