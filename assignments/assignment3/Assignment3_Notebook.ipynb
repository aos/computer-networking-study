    "The last assignment involved programming a distributed routing algorithm in a simulated network.  In this assignment, you will create your own network simulation to investigate the dynamics of TCP and how seemingly minor configuration decisions made by network operators can have major performance effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in lecture, TCP is a protocol for obtaining reliable transmission over an unreliable packet-switched network. Another important component of TCP is congestion control, i.e. limiting end host send rates to prevent network infrastructure from getting overwhelmed with traffic. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, networks can suffer congestion-related performance issues even when end hosts use TCP. One such issue, known as bufferbloat, can occur when packet buffers on routers and switches are too large. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use Mininet, a useful tool for network experiments, to emulate a small network and collect various performance statistics relevant to TCP congestion control and bufferbloat. This will allow you to reason about the effects of TCP and router configuration on network performance.   \n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TCP Congestion Window Size\n",
    "The TCP congestion window size parameter, typically styled \"cwnd,\" is maintained by the sender and determines how much traffic can be outstanding (sent but not acknowledged) at any time. There are many algorithms for controlling the value of cwnd during a TCP connection, all with the goal of maximizing the connection's throughput while preventing congestion. The additive increase and multiplicative decrease algorithm was discussed in lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bufferbloat\n",
    "Bufferbloat is a phenomenon that happens when a switching device is configured to use excessively large buffers, which can in turn cause high latency and packet delay variation (jitter). This can happen even in a typical home network like the following:\n",
    "<img width=600 src=\"figures/home-network.png\">\n",
    "Here, the end host in the home network is connected to the home router. The home router is then connected, via cable or DSL, to a headend router run by the Internet service provider (ISP). By simulating and experimenting with a similar network in Mininet, you will see how bufferbloat causes poor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mininet\n",
    "Mininet is a network emulator with which you can create a custom network of virtual hosts, switches, controllers, and links, all on a single computer. The virtual devices in the emulated network can run real programs; anything that can run on linux can run on a Mininet device too. This makes Mininet a valuable tool for fast and easy simulation of network protcols and measurements. This [Introduction to Mininet](https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet) is a useful guide for getting started with Mininet's Python API.  The [Mininet website](www.mininet.org) has additional resources if you are interested."

    "To start, you should first create the following network using Mininet's Python API, which emulates a typical home netowrk:\n",
    "<img width=450 src=\"figures/mininet-topo.png\">\n",
    "Here h1 is your home computer that has a fast connection (1Gb/s) to your home router. The home router has a slow uplink connection (1.5Mb/s). The round-trip propagation delay, or the minimum RTT between h1 and h2 is 20ms.  The router buffer (queue) size will be the parameterized independent variable in your simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a custom topology in Mininet, we extend the mininet.topo.Topo class. We have already added the switch (the router) to topology for you. You need to add h1, h2, and links with appropriate characteristics to create the setting specified in the image above.  The first few subsections of the [Working with Mininet](https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet#working) section of the Mininet guide describe how to add elements to a topology and set performance parameters.
