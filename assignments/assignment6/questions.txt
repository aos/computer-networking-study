Question 1) Approximately how long into the simulation (seconds)
            is the DNS reflection attack detected? 
            How can you tell this from the DNS response rate plot?

Question 2) With what probability does your implementation drop 
            DNS response packets to perform rate limiting?

Question 3) Why did you choose this probability? 
            How does changing this probability affect
            the DNS response rate plot? (Re-run the experiment
            with different probability values if you are not sure).

Question 4) What components of the detection/mitigation technique used in this assignment
            may not be optimal for real-world deployment? 
            Choose one and explain how it could be improved.

Question 5) DNS reflection attacks are of real concern in the global Internet, 
            but a general solution that does not involve updating all
            connected hosts at once has yet to be found. 

	    Think about the reasons why DNS reflection attacks are possible 
            (e.g. what does the attacker do, what does the DNS resolver do, 
            what causes the victim to be negatively affected). 

            Pick one of these reasons and brainstorm methods to prevent it, 
            thereby preventing DNS reflection attacks 
            (even if these methods require a complete Internet upgrade). 

            Describe the reason you chose and a possible prevention method
            you came up with.  

            This question is intentionally open-ended and will be graded leniently. 
            Try to be concise yet thorough.
