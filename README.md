## Computer Networking Self-Study

Since computer networking is a vast and deep subject, I wanted to at least get
a start understanding how it all works under the hood. I also wanted to take a
programming approach as it seems like the standard advice is to build projects
that implement various RFCs or play around with Wireshark.

1. [Beej's Guide to Networking Programming](http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/)
2. Stanford's [Introduction to Computer Networking](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Networking-SP/SelfPaced/)
3. Supplement that with readings, projects, assignments.

### Readings

Standard advice says that I should be using [Computer Networking: A Top-down
Approach](http://ce.sharif.edu/courses/94-95/2/ce443-3/resources/root/Book/fqo47.Computer.Networking.A.TopDown.Approach.6th.Edition.pdf). [**PDF warning**]

Assigned readings:
- [ ] Unit 1: Sections 1.1-1.3; 1.5; 2.1
- [ ] Unit 2: Sections 3.1-3.5
- [ ] Unit 3: pp. 22-31; 640-648
- [ ] Unit 4: pp. 259-265; 269-279
- [ ] Unit 5: pp. 83-114
- [ ] Unit 6: pp. 305-379
- [ ] Unit 7: pp. 433-443
- [ ] Unit 8: pp. 671-693

### Assignments & Projects

I will be using the assignments found on [Princeton's Computer Networks
repository](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/COS461-Public) as well as my
own study of this topic!
